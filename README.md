I have created the assignement in react.js
I have used Spoonacular API api with diffent HTTT query  
// https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?apiKey=22e29551523745719f4e8aa8956f850d&query=${debounceSearch}&addRecipeInformation=true&instructionsRequired=true
I have implemented different functionalities 
Like debouncing while fetching the data with delay time of 2 seconds 
Use of props to pass on the data and to show the search result 

I have used the react router to change the pages, however I statred working on the project in moring so the project is not completed as per the task requirements 
Stated working at 8:00 Am - 12pm after that system stared updaing so uploading the project till now.

Tasks which are still unachieved 
Storing the favourite recipy in a different page , (I would have used localstore to save the data in local so it don't get disappear when refresh)
